# Contributing


I love pull requests from everyone. Please note that by participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [code of conduct].

[code of conduct]: ./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

----
**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

----

Fork, then clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/pair.git

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]. For this project, you don't need to wait until everything is working to open your pull request. I appreciate the space pull requests offer to comment on what could be a good approach to the problem.

At this point you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on pull requests within a few days (and, typically, one day). If I fail to do so, please send me a note at pairproject@fastmail.com!
Most likely it's been a busy week and I've missed the Github notification.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests, if you know how. If you don't explain what you want to achieve, I can help you writing the tests for it.
* Be ready to 🍐 pair on getting your pull request ready to merge (is that a surprise?)
* Write your commit messages [following these guidelines][commit], I find that they help getting in the message the context that matters the most.
