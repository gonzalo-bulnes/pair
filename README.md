You love attributing your pairs when [committing together][together]? We all do!

But writing names once and again is repetitive enough that we forget doing it, isn't it?

Not anymore! Start your pairing sessions and switch pairs with a simple üçê command, while keeping control over your commit messages! Ready to get started?

  [together]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/

Usage
-----

```bash
pair with "Gonzalo <gonzalo.bulnes@redbubble.com>" # that's all!

# Wanna pair swap?
pair with "Alice <alice@example.com>"

# Never stop pairing!
# Well, if you do:
pair stop
```

That sounds cool, [how does it work?](./doc/README.md)

You might also want to check [**git-pair**](https://github.com/thechutrain/git-pair), an independent project that seems similar in spirit to [the approach proposed in #12](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/pair/issues/12). Also written in Go, it might be a nice opportunity to see different approaches to the same problem!
